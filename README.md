Food Tracker AI ü•ó

Replace "YOUR ID" with your actual id in Clarifai.js, Index.html, Script.js.

A smart nutrition tracking application that leverages artificial intelligence to simplify food logging. Users can upload an image of their meal, and the app will automatically identify the food and fetch its detailed nutritional information.

Features
üì∏ AI-Powered Image Recognition: Upload an image of any food, and the application will use the Clarifai API to identify it with a confidence score.
üìä Instant Nutritional Analysis: Once a food is identified, its nutritional data (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates) is fetched from the Nutritionix API and displayed.
‚úçÔ∏è Manual Entry: A robust manual search bar allows users to look up any food item that can't be recognized by image.
üí° Quick Suggestions: Common food items like 'Pizza', 'Salad', and 'Chicken' are available as one-click buttons for faster searching.
üîí Secure Backend Proxy: A Node.js and Express server acts as a proxy to securely handle API requests, resolving browser CORS issues and protecting API keys.

The Problem It Solves
Traditional calorie counting apps require tedious manual searching and data entry. This project demonstrates a more intuitive "snap and track" approach, making it faster and easier for users to log their meals and stay on top of their nutritional goals.
